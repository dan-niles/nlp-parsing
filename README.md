# NLP Parsers

This repository contains a two parsers I used for assignments in CS4661: Natural Language Processing. They are:

1. CFG Parser
2. Earley Parser

### Acknowledgements

The code for the Earley parser is based on this [script](https://gist.github.com/bufas/65022d522b5bb31cc0d9). I have made some modifications to it to make it work with the grammar rules I have defined.
